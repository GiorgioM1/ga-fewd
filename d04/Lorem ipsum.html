    You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life. The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!

    When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words.
